	Badha = Bound or Restrained, Kona = Angle, Asana = Pose or Posture<br> 
This pose is pronounced as BAH-dah-cone-AHS-ana.<br>
The posture is named Badhakonasana because of the way it is carried out â€“ both the feet tucked close to the groin, clasped tightly with the hands as though tied or bound together in a particular angle. It is also popularly known as the Butterfly Pose because of the movement of the legs during the posture, giving the appearance of a butterfly flapping its wings. The posture is also sometimes known as the Cobbler Pose as it resembles the sitting position of a cobbler at work.
	<h2>How To Do:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sit with your spine erect and legs spread straight out.</li>
<li>Now bend your knees and bring your feet towards the pelvis. The soles of your feet should touch each other.</li>
<li>Grab your feet tightly with your hands. You may place the hands underneath the feet for support.</li>
<li>Make an effort to bring the heels as close to the genitals as possible.</li>
<li>Take a deep breath in. Breathing out, press the thighs and knees downward towards the floor. Make a gentle effort to keep pressing them downward.</li>
<li>Now start flapping both the legs up and down like the wings of a butterfly. Start slow and gradually increase the speed. Keep breathing normally throughout.</li>
<li>Fly higher and higher, as fast as you comfortably can. Slow down and then stop. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, bend forward, keeping the chin up and spine erect.</li>
<li>Press your elbows on the thighs or on the knees, pushing the knees and thighs closer to the floor.</li>
<li>Feel the stretch in the inner thighs and take long, deep breaths, relaxing the muscles more and more.</li>
<li>Take a deep breath in and bring the torso up.</li>
<li>As you exhale, gently release the posture. Straighten the legs out in front of you and relax.</li>
</ol>	
	<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<ol>
<li>A good stretch for the inner thighs, groins and knees, improving flexibility in the groin and hip region</li>
<li>Helps in intestine and bowel movement</li>
<li>Removes fatigue from long hours of standing and walking</li>
<li>Offers relief from menstrual discomfort and menopause symptoms</li>
<li>Helps in smooth delivery if practiced regularly until late pregnancy</li>
</ol>
	<h2>Cautions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are suffering from groin or knee injury, make sure you keep a blanket under the outer thighs for support. </li>
Do not perform this pose without blanket support.</li>
<li>Also, sciatica patients should either completely avoid the pose or sit on a cushion to raise the hips.</li>
<li>If you have any lower-back disorders, do the posture only while keeping the spine erect.</li>
<li>Avoid rounding up the spine by bending forward.	</li>
</ul>
