	<h1 align="center"><i>Bakasana</i></h1>
	Crow Pose is often the first arm balance that yoga students tackle. Though it looks like it's all about arm strength, the keys are actually learning where your center of gravity is and how to distribute your weight so that you can balance. The biggest hurdle to overcome is usually a reluctance to move enough of your weight forward into your hands. When you find that sweet spot, the feet just pop off the floor almost on their own.
  <h2>How To Do:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Plant your palms firmly on the mat about a foot in front of your feet. Spread your fingers wide and press into the top joint of each finger.</li>
<li>Bend your elbows straight back. Don't bend them into full Chaturanga arms, but head in that direction.</li>
<li>Come up onto the balls of your feet and open your knees so that they line up with your upper arms.</li>
<li>Place your knees on the backs of your upper arms.</li>
<li>Begin to bring your weight forward into your hands, lifting your head as you go.</li>
<li>Come up onto your tiptoes, then lift one foot and then the other off the floor.</li>
<li>Engage the inner thighs for support while keeping the knees on the arms.</li>
<li>Hug your feet toward your butt.</li>
<li>Focus on the feeling of the body lifting. Avoid sinking into the pose, which can dump weight into the shoulders.</li>
<li>To come out, exhale and transfer your weight back until your feet come back to the floor</li>	
</ol>	
	<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Crow Pose strengthens the wrist, forearms, and abdomen while stretching your upper back.</li>
<li>It improves balance and core strength. Mastering Crow builds your yoga confidence and opens the door to many more poses involving arm balance.</li>
<li>You will improve your awareness of where your body is in space and enhance your body control.</li>
</ol>	
	<h2>Cautions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a pose to avoid if you have any wrist or shoulder injury or condition such as carpal tunnel syndrome. It is not recommended if you are pregnant.</li>
<li>Traditionally, it is said that this pose should not be done if you have insomnia.</li>
<li>Put a blanket in front of you so you won't be afraid of hitting your head if you fall. Chances are you will tip forward at least once while learning this pose. You want that to be as soft of a landing as possible.</li>
