      <h2>History of Yoga</h2>
     <p><b>Pre-Classical Yoga</b></p><p>
     <img style="float:left; width:45%;padding:1%;" src="https://i1.wp.com/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/masjcsimgs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/05132816/yoga4.png?fit=438%2C319&ssl=1">
    The beginnings of Yoga were developed by the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India over 5,000 years ago. The word yoga was first mentioned in the oldest sacred texts, the Rig Veda. The Vedas were a collection of texts containing songs, mantras and rituals to be used by Brahmans, the Vedic priests. Yoga was slowly refined and developed by the Brahmans and Rishis (mystic seers) who documented their practices and beliefs in the Upanishads, a huge work containing over 200 scriptures. The most renowned of the Yogic scriptures is the Bhagavad-Gîtâ, composed around 500 B.C.E. The Upanishads took the idea of ritual sacrifice from the Vedas and internalized it, teaching the sacrifice of the ego through self-knowledge, action (karma yoga) and wisdom (jnana yoga).</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><b>Classical Yoga</b></p>
    <p>
     <img style="float:right;width:40%;height:50%" src="https://cdnbbendpoint.azureedge.net/balancegurus/uploads/job-manager-uploads%2Ffeatured_image%2F2016%2F07%2FClassical-Yoga-Hindu-Academy-Dharma-Ashram10.jpg">
      In the pre-classical stage, yoga was a mishmash of various ideas, beliefs and techniques that often conflicted and contradicted each other. The Classical period is defined by Patanjali’s Yoga-Sûtras, the first systematic presentation of yoga. Written some time in the second century, this text describes the path of Raja Yoga, often called "classical yoga". Patanjali organized the practice of yoga into an "eight limbed path" containing the steps and stages towards obtaining Samadhi or enlightenment. Patanjali is often considered the father of yoga and his Yoga-Sûtras still strongly influence most styles of modern yoga.
    </p><br>
    <p><b>Post-Classical Yoga</b></p>
    <p>
     <img style="float:left;height:270px; padding: 1%" src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/historyofyoga-150413075954-conversion-gate01/95/history-of-yoga-5-638.jpg?cb=1428912045"> A few centuries after Patanjali, yoga masters created a system of practices designed to rejuvenate the body and prolong life. They rejected the teachings of the ancient Vedas and embraced the physical body as the means to achieve enlightenment. They developed Tantra Yoga, with radical techniques to cleanse the body and mind to break the knots that bind us to our physical existence. This exploration of these physical-spiritual connections and body centered practices led to the creation of what we primarily think of yoga in the West: Hatha Yoga.
     Around 500 B.C.E. (Before the Common Era), the Bhagavad-Gita was created. It’s a beautiful story of a conversation between the God-man Krishna and the soldier Prince Arjuna.  In the Bhagavad-Gita (or simply “Gita” as it’s often referred to as), three aspects must be brought mutually in our existence:    1) Bhakti (devotion) 2) Jnana (knowledge),  3) Karma (cause and effect)

      <img style="float:right;width:500px;"src="https://www.yogajournal.com/.image/t_share/MTQ2MTgwNzU3NTczNzQwMDY0/marketing-yoga.jpg">In the late 1800s and early 1900s, yoga masters began to travel to the West, attracting attention and followers. This began at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, when Swami Vivekananda wowed the attendees with his lectures on yoga and the universality of the world’s religions. In the 1920s and 30s, Hatha Yoga was strongly promoted in India with the work of T. Krishnamacharya, Swami Sivananda and other yogis practicing Hatha Yoga. Krishnamacharya opened the first Hatha Yoga school in Mysore in 1924 and in 1936 Sivananda founded the Divine Life Society on the banks of the holy Ganges River. Krishnamacharya produced three students that would continue his legacy and increase the popularity of Hatha Yoga: B.K.S. Iyengar, T.K.V. Desikachar and Pattabhi Jois. Sivananda was a prolific author, writing over 200 books on yoga, and established nine ashrams and numerous yoga centers located around the world.

      <h2>Getting started with yoga</h2>
      <p>
      	Yoga isn’t one-size-fits-all, but it’s one of the few exercises that actually offers different “sizes” for people to try. If you’re new, it’s worth trying different styles to find which best resonates with you. Here’s a summary of the main types of yoga:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Iyengar</b>
        </li><img style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://yogaschool.asia/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Thumbnail-Su-Unn-305.jpg">
<p>- Iyengar Yoga, named after and developed by B. K. S. Iyengar, and described in his bestselling[1] 1966 book Light on Yoga, is a form of yoga as exercise that has an emphasis on detail, precision and alignment in the performance of yoga postures <br>This type is a combination of standing and seated postures using props for people who want to focus on alignment, posture, and gain increased muscular power and range of motion.</p>

<li><b>Viniyoga</b></li>
<img style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pwK7AAo7VxI/hqdefault.jpg">
<p> -Tirumalai Krishnamacharya Venkata Desikachar (21 June 1938 – 8 August 2016), better known as T. K. V. Desikachar, was a yoga teacher, son of the pioneer of modern yoga as exercise, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya.<br> The style that he taught is called Viniyoga A class that’s focused on breathing and meditation for people with limited mobility or who want to work from the inside out, to experience relaxation, body awareness, and better posture.</p>
<li><b>Jivanmukti</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://www.awaken.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jivamukti.jpg">
<p> -The Jivamukti Yoga method is a proprietary style of yoga created by David Life and Sharon Gannon in 1984.<br>
  Jivamukti is a physical, ethical, and spiritual practice, combining a vigorous yoga as exercise, vinyasa-based physical style with adherence to five central tenets: shastra, bhakti, ahimsā, nāda, and dhyana. It also emphasizes animal rights, veganism, environmentalism and social activism A set sequence that incorporates meditation, compassion, chanting, and deep listening, for people whowant to incorporate spiritual elements and ancient teachings of yoga in their practice while gaining body awareness, learning Sanskrit, and improving relationships.</p>
<li><b>Hatha</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://www.livelifekingsize.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hatha-Yoga.png">
<p> - Haṭha yoga is a branch of yoga. The Sanskrit word हठ haṭha literally means "force" and thus alludes to a system of physical techniques.
  In India, haṭha yoga is associated in popular tradition with the Yogis of the Natha Sampradaya through its traditional founder Matsyendranath. This type uses yoga poses and breathing techniques to align and calm the body, mind, and spirit in preparation for meditation. Classes are slower paced, but holding the poses can be more physically demanding.</p>
<li><b>Vinyasa</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://magazine.bluekarmasecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vinyasa-Yoga-1200x675.jpg">
<p> - A  vinyasa[1] (Sanskrit: विन्यास, IAST: vinyāsa) is a smooth transition between asanas in styles of modern yoga as exercise such as Vinyasa Krama Yoga, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and Bikram Yoga,[2] especially when movement is paired with the breath This dynamic type synchronizes movement with breath and may be referred to as a “flow class.” Expect to move faster than in a traditional Hatha class.</p>
<li><b>Ashtanga</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://www.akshiyogashala.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/download.jpg">
<p> -Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga is a style of yoga as exercise created by K. Pattabhi Jois during the 20th century, often promoted as a modern-day form of classical Indian yoga.[1] He claimed to have learnt the system from his teacher, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. The style is energetic, synchronising breath with movements. Ashtanga goes through a fast-paced and physically challenging sequence of poses practiced in the same order with a strong emphasis on the breath. In traditional classes, you aren’t meant to drink water and can only move onto the next pose or series after you’ve achieved the last.</p>
<li><b>Bikram</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://media.timeout.com/images/103342574/630/472/image.jpg">
<p> - Bikram Yoga is a proprietary system of hot yoga as exercise devised by Bikram Choudhury; it became popular in the early 1970s. Classes consist of a fixed sequence of 26 postures, practised in a room heated to 105 °F (41 °C) with a humidity of 40%, intended to replicate the climate of India.  Bikram consists of two breathing techniques and 26 poses repeated in the same order for 90 minutes. It’s often practiced in a room heated to 105°F (40.6°C) to help sweat out toxins.</p>
<li><b>Kundalini</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://www.yogajournal.com/.image/t_share/MTU0MjAzOTg1MTg2NzkyNzg0/web-10bodiessequence-4.jpg">
<p></p> - Kundalini yoga (kuṇḍalinī-yoga) derives from kundalini, defined in Hindu lore as energy that lies dormant at the base of the spine until it is activated (as by the practice of yoga) and channeled upward through the chakras in the process of spiritual perfection This type incorporates repeated movements (referred to as a “kriya”), dynamic breathing, mantras, chanting, and meditation. It’s believed to awaken the energy at the base of the spine and draw it upward through the chakras.</p>
<li><b>Yin</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://www.yogajournal.com/.image/t_share/MTQ2MTgwNjcyNDc4MzI0MTU3/yin-yoga--shannon-stephens-pigeon-pose.jpg">
<p> -Yin Yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga as exercise, incorporating principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, with asanas (postures) that are held for longer periods of time. For beginners, asanas may be held from 45 seconds to two minutes; more advanced practitioners may stay in one asana for five minutes or more  Poses are held for 3-5 minutes, mainly in a lying down or seated position. The longer stretches aim to release tension and restore range of motion to muscles and connective tissue. It’s helpful for people who have tight muscles, stress, or chronic pain.</p>
<li><b>Restorative</b></li>
<img  style="float:left;height:80px;width:90px;" src="https://www.verywellfit.com/thmb/EQehoQCLBOMZEOfs5Rs24oudOQ8=/1500x1125/smart/filters:no_upscale()/restorative-56aa41c05f9b58b7d0035224.jpg">
<p> -Restorative Yoga is the practice of asanas, each held for longer than in conventional classes, often with the support of props such as folded blankets, to relax the body. Very gentle poses are held for 10 minutes or more. Includes plenty of props for support and relaxation, such as blankets, bolsters, and straps. Similar to Yin yoga, this is a helpful practice for people living with chronic pain or anyone feeling stressed.</p>

         <h2><b>Tips For Beginners:</b></h2>
      	<p><h3>1.Don’t Compare Yourself With Others</h3></p>
      	<p>Look inwards to your own progress; there will always be more flexible, strong and beautiful people around in your yoga class, as in life. Yoga may be fashionable, but it is not a spectator sport or a competition. Appreciate the subtle progress of your own practice, the best part of it is on the inside, in the healing awareness and unity of your own body, mind and spirit.</p></div>
      <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>2.Be Aware Of The Space Around You</h3></p>
        <p>Yoga classes can be packed out; be aware of the need to leave enough space between yourself and others so that if you topple from your Tree Pose, you don’t knock over your neighbor too. There is a certain etiquette of respectful awareness of sharing space with others that is a lovely part of yoga practice.
      </p></div>
      <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>3.Have A Sense Of Humor</h3></p>
      	<p>Yoga is a quiet, focused activity, but we need not to take ourselves too seriously. We may feel ungainly and stiff as a board as we try to navigate ourselves into new poses. Humility, an inner smile and a bit of gentleness can save us from pushing ourselves to the point of strain and injury.</p></div>
    
    <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>4.Eating And Drinking And Yoga</h3></p>
      	<p>It is advisable not to eat for one or two hours before yoga practice, and to drink only small amounts of water beforehand and do not drink during practice. Avoid alcohol, sugar or caffeine before yoga.</p></div>

    <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>5.Stay hydrated</h3></p>
        <p>Water is key when you start any physical activity, so make sure you drink at least 1,5 liters per day. Take a bottle of water to your every yoga class.</p></div>
    <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>6.Take care of comfortable clothes</h3></p>
        <p>The basic kit you will need consists of stretchy pants or leggings and a top. You need to make sure your clothes are comfortable and allow for free movement.</p></div>

    <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>7.Get rid of any distractions</h3></p>
        <p> Respect the time dedicated to the yoga practice. Leave your watch, phone, or any other device at the door. A yoga class pretty much is about staying focused.</p>
        <p>Get rid of those thoughts that take you away from the studio and return to the office. You must focus on your goals and the asanas you perform while practicing yoga. Any negligence can at times result in serious injuries.</p></div>
  
     <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>8.Keep your spirits up and practice regularly</h3></p>
        <p> Remember that every beginning is challenging. If something doesn’t work out, try it later. Manage your motivation smartly, and don’t listen to anybody but your inner voice.
        Try to practice yoga every day. Choose the most suitable time for you and devote it entirely to yoga every day. Even if you do it just for 20 minutes, try new postures step by step. After a while, you’ll become more experienced and learn more poses.
    Yoga is a very rewarding and worthwhile practice. It surely is worth your time and effort. Keep your spirits up and have fun!</p></div>
  
  <div class="fakeimg"><p><h3>9.Buy a sticky mat</h3></p>
        <p>A sticky mat is an indispensable tool for some poses. Beginners often have balance problems, and a sticky mat will ease the proves and help you avoid problems such as muscle sprains and cramps.</p></div>
