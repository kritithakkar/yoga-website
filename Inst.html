      <p>You’ve made the decision that now is the time to start yoga.<br>
       That’s amazing because the benefits of yoga are many. Yoga can help you do everything from ease your back pain to get into incredible shape. Plus, it’s low impact. Now for a few details such as how to choose a yoga class and what schedule is best when you are a beginner?</p>
       <h3>Beginning Yoga Schedule</h3>
       <p>
         <img style="float:right; width:270px; " src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/09/iStock-1131794876.t5d482e40.m800.xtDADj9SvTVFjzuNeGuNUUGY4tm5d6UGU5tkKM0s3iPk-620x342.jpg">
        Like any physical activity, it’s better to ease into yoga. This allows your body time to get used to the movement and build strength, balance, and flexibility. Taking it slowly also gives you an opportunity to learn specific “skills” yoga builds—such as moving with grace and fluidity. And this approach means you’re less likely to get injured.<br>
        <b>If you are new to yoga, aim for 2­-3 times a week, with a day of rest after each practice.</b><br>
        But wait, I’ve heard yoga should be done daily? <br>
        That’s true, but that statement refers to yoga as a meditation practice. Yoga in a yoga studio is primarily a physical endeavor, and so your best advice is to go slow.<br>
        <b>After 60 days you can move to 4-­5 times a week.</b> That might look like Monday, Wednesday, Friday and a Saturday or Sunday. <b>Always have at least one day of rest each week.</b> Your body needs time to recover, and you’ll discover you feel more energized and stronger after a day off. <br>
        <ul>
        <li>New to Yoga: <b>2-3 Times per Week</b></li>
        <li>After 60 day:  <b>4-5 times per week</b></li>
        </ul>
        Find a balance between not practicing enough (less than one time a week on average) and overdoing it. <b>Being sore the next day indicates you overworked.</b><br>
        <i>These recommendations assume that you are in good health and physically able to participate in fitness activities. Always consult your doctor if you have any concerns.</i><br>
        There will be differences from person-to-person, but these are reliable general guidelines.

        One common misconception is that if you work out regularly, say by running, or spinning, then you can jump right into a more rigorous schedule.<br>
         Two reasons that might not be the best approach.<br>
         First, <b>yoga is a skill.</b> Like any skill, it takes time to learn and develop. And while your other activities, such as CrossFit or surfing, will help you in many ways, <b>yoga is specific to yoga.</b> <br>

The second reason is that the body gets strong based on how you use it. If you do an activity that relies on your legs, as runners or cyclists do, then that’s where you have strength. Many athletic pursuits create imbalances in our physiques because of the nature of the sport. It’s so specific that at the extreme are tennis players who have one forearm more developed than the other.<br>

<b> Yoga is a full body exercise.</b> The exciting thing is over time it can help you bring balance back to your body.<br>

Set yourself up for success by choosing a schedule that will let you practice for a long time if you so desire. <br>

<h3>How to Stick to A Yoga Schedule</h3>

We all have good intentions, but life gets busy. Here are some strategies that can make it easier to get to your mat. <br>
<ul>
<li><b>Set a Goal</b></li>
Goals give you something to focus on and make your wants more tangible. As a beginner, set a 1-month goal to complete 10-12 workouts. This is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely. And it will help you build momentum.<br>
<li><b>Invite a friend</b></li>
This works. Making a yoga date with others makes it more social and supportive. You’ll find the same people practice at the same time on the same day. And as you discover your routine you’ll meet others who will become friends.<br>
<li><b>Schedule it</b></li>
Put the times you are going to practice yoga on your calendar. It provides a visual reminder and serves as a commitment you have made to yourself.<br>
<li><b>Bring the Fun</b></li>
Find a class that you enjoy and consider fun. You’re putting the power of psychology to work for you; if it’s fun, you’ll want to keep doing it.<br>
<li><b>Reward Yourself</b></li>
One more plug for psychology—give yourself an incentive. Set up a reward system for when you finish a week of classes or your first month. Having something to look forward to is motivating.<br>
<h3>How do I get good at yoga?</h3>
<img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/set-people-practicing-yoga_1262-19347.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg"><br>
<br>We all have a desire to be good at the things we do. <br>
Yoga is a skill and that works in your favor because<b> you can learn skills.</b> <br>
They take time, commitment, and a step-by-step approach.<b> The goal is to build a sustainable practice—</b>one that you can enjoy as long as you choose. <br>
Put the time in, week-by-week, month-by-month. If you do, you’ll start to see changes. You’ll be stronger, calmer and more at ease. You’ll feel better and many aches and pains, the result of body imbalances, will disappear. <br>
It can happen because it’s happened for millions. <br>
One final note.<b> Everyone who practiced yoga, or has ever practiced, was once new too.</b>You’re in good company.
